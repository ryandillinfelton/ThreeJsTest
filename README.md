# Hey, don't fork this it's not forth it

This is a simple proof of concept I wanted to do to integrate webGL with the DOM.
I plan to apply some of these concepts to some upcoming projects, hopefully in a
more reasonable way and with React or Vue. Anyways this one is sloppy as hell,
but there is some fun stuff going on so feel free to check it out. Yes scroling
is bad right now. Maybe I'll fix it later but :shrug:.
